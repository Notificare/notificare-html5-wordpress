Smart push notifications for WordPress websites.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to sign up to Notificare to use this plugin? =

Yes. You can also try it for 30 days before considering a paid plan. You can upgrade or cancel it at anytime.

= Do I need a Premium Support account? =

No. But it is recommended. Our Premium Support plans allow you to contact our engineering team 24/7 through our help desk at support.notifica.re.

= Which browsers support your notifications? =

All the major browsers out there support our Website Push functionality. In Chrome, Firefox and Safari we use native notifications functionality, when this is not available we will fall back to WebSockets.
